//2b. Using addEventListener, have an alert that says "OH NO! The squirrels are on to you. Now you have to leave this reality and move to a new one" pop up when you hover over the h3

//BONUS
//4a. Select the Dark Mode button and set it to a const variable called darkMode
//===========================================
const darkMode = document.getElementById('dm');
//===========================================
//4b. Using addEventListener, TOGGLE the "dark-mode" CSS class On/Off for EVERY element when the Dark Mode Button is clicked (HINT: You will need to use the asterisk "*" selector as well as a loop)
//===========================================
const all = document.querySelectorAll('*');
darkMode.addEventListener('click', () => {
   for (element of all){
       element.classList.toggle('dark-mode')

//===========================================

//===========================================
//5b. Using addEventListener, have an alert that says "You have successfully moved to another reality" pop up when you click on the button. However, have this setup so that when the button is clicked a third time have the following alert display instead of the "You have successfully moved to another reality" alert. New alert "OH NO! You can only move to a new another reality a couple times. You are stuck in this reality!". And finally, when the button is clicked a fourth, fifth, sixth, etc. time have it do nothing (AKA Disable the button).
